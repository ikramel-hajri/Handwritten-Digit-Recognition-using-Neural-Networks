# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks

This repository contains a Python project for recognizing handwritten digits using a fully-connected neural network. It's designed to work with the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 28x28 pixel grayscale images of zip code digits, each annotated with its corresponding label.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Required Python libraries (you can install them using `pip`):
  - TensorFlow
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib

 ### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ikramel-hajri/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Neural-Networks.git
    ```

## Acknowledgments

- The MNIST dataset used in this project is provided by Yann LeCun. More information can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
